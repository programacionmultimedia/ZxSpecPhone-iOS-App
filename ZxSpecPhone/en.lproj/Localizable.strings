It does not offer more functionality than the normal phone, but it gives a retro feel to your device.

If you like the app, you have any suggestions or want to entrust the development of your business application, you can send an email to correo.flores@gmail.com or send it directly from right here by clicking the EMAIL button.

Enjoy the application!";
